		<h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></span> Hello and welcome!</h3>
			<p>
				Well... it's kind of hard to put thoughts into words but after a long struggle I've managed to write this whole line and it only took me 10 minutes, so... imagine what I can do in an hour?</p>
				<p> Well, you're right! I'll leave the writing to the writers and focus next on the design of my site. The previous version was solely my creation, but this one... well, this one uses Bootstrap for a total face lift! Below I’ve added a link to my Github repository containing all my projects (so far only two, but I’m hopeful) so feel free to browse it!</p>

			<h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></span> Contact</h3>
