		<h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></span> Hello and welcome!</h3>
			<p>Well.. this is my second try at building a personal website, I think this is a much better version than the first one so.. I'm posting this online. Also check out the "Stuff" page which contains links to the rest of my projects, even the early ones.</p>
			<p>The previous version of my homepage was created from scratch but this one uses the Bootstrap CSS framework which I just recently found out about. Below Iâ€™ve added a link to my Github repository containing all my projects so feel free to browse it!</p>

			<h3><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-envelope"></span> Contact</h3>
